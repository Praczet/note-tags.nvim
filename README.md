# note-tags

THIS IS WIP and for now there is no point to install it :-) Still learning

Ok. This is my second plugin. This time I will try to use telescope. The main purpose of it is to tags notes. On the bottom of notes I am putting tags such as `#sql #JSON` etc. This plugin should open Telescope read all tags from files in a folder[^1] and display list in telescope. After selecting tag it should show list of files having this tag.

# ToDo

Everything :-D

[^1]: Folder should be or declared in config or plugin will take current one.
